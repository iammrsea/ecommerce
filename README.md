# E-commerce website

This is a statically generated [NuxtJs App](https://nuxtjs.org) (a [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org) framework), for an e-commerce website for a hypothetical company.

The styling was done using [Materializecss](https://materializecss.com). I built the Materialzecss classes into Vuejs components (a combination of functional and non-functional components).

The NuxJs App serves both the Admin and Customer Dashboard UIs built with ReactJs. You can checkout the source codes for the Admin and Customer Dashboard UIs [here](https://github.com/iammrsea/ecommerce-AdminUI) and [here](https://github.com/iammrsea/ecommerce-AdminUI/tree/customer-dashboard) respectively. And for the backend source code implemented with [NestJs](https://nestjs.com), check [here](https://github.com/iammrsea/ecommerc-NestJsBackend)
